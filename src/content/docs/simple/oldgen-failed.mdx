# Making Old Generation

With a primitive that provokes young GC in our hand, let's create an old generation.

How? Create enough GC until the generation is old enough

## JVM command line

But how old is "old enough". To find that out we need the `-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=`
command line option.

Let's write a short class that would enable us to easily receive every command line option
of our virtual machine.


```java
import com.sun.management.HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean;

import javax.management.MBeanServer;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.lang.management.ManagementFactory;

public class GetVmOptions {
  static MBeanServer mbs =
       ManagementFactory.getPlatformMBeanServer();
  static HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean mbean;

  static {
    try {
      mbean = ManagementFactory.newPlatformMXBeanProxy(mbs,
          "com.sun.management:type=HotSpotDiagnostic",
          HotSpotDiagnosticMXBean.class);
    } catch (IOException e) {
      throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
  }

  public static int get(String key) {
    String value = mbean.getVMOption(key).getValue();
    return Integer.valueOf(value);
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    System.out.println("will tenure after = " +
                       get("MaxTenuringThreshold"));
  }
}
```

Let's run that:

```bash
❯ javac *.java
❯ java -cp . GetVmOptions
will tenure after = 15
```

By default we need 15 rounds of GC until object is promoted to the eldery zone.

## Promotion

Let's go ahead and promote some objects to be oldgen!

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Random;

public class MakeOldgen {
  static long MB = 1024 * 1024;

  static class Eldery {
    static int blockSize = 512;
    public ArrayList<byte[]> oldgen;

    public Eldery removeMb(int mb) {
      long bytes = mb * MB;
      Random rnd = new Random();
      while (bytes > 0) {
        int to_del = rnd.nextInt(oldgen.size());
        oldgen.remove(to_del);
        bytes -= blockSize;
      }
      return this;
    }

    public Eldery addMb(int mb) {
      long bytes = mb * MB;
      oldgen = new ArrayList<>();
      while (bytes > 0) {
        oldgen.add(new byte[blockSize]);
        bytes -= blockSize;
      }
      return this;
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int tenuring_off = 1;
    if (args.length >= 1) {
      tenuring_off = Integer.valueOf(args[0]);
    }
    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
    long baseline = rt.freeMemory();
    int tenuring_thres = GetVmOptions.get("MaxTenuringThreshold");
    System.out.println("Objs tenure after surviving " +
        tenuring_thres +
        " rounds of GC. Running " +
        (tenuring_thres + tenuring_off) +
        " rounds");
    Eldery oldgen = makeOldgen(40);
    System.out.println("Heap: Promoting 20MB oldgen");
    for (int i = 0; i < tenuring_thres + tenuring_off; i++) {
      ProvokeYoungGC.provoke();
    }
    System.out.println("Heap: Now running GC after promotion");
    oldgen = null;
    ProvokeYoungGC.provoke();
    System.out.println("Heap: Now done");
  }

  public static Eldery makeOldgen(int mb) {
    return new Eldery().addMb(mb);
  }
}
```

What we're doing here is:

  1. Allocating 20MB of small objects
  2. Provoking young GC 15 times (configurable by command line)
  3. We expect many objects to be promoted to the old generation.
  4. Hence additional young GC would not affect the old generation
     and memory consumption would remain similar.

## Promotion Visibility

Did that work? We've already learned of [JFR](/simple/jfr), so let's use
just that to find out! We'll enable all events with "Promot" in
the name, to inspect promotion related events.

```bash
❯ javac *.java && java -cp . JFRConfig -c Promot

❯ java \
  -XX:StartFlightRecording=dumponexit=true,settings=conf.jfc,filename=dump.jfr \
  -XX:+UseG1GC -cp . MakeOldgen
Started recording 1. No limit specified, using maxsize=250MB as default.

Use jcmd 12634 JFR.dump name=1 to copy recording data to file.
Objs tenure after surviving 15 rounds of GC. Running 16 rounds
Heap: Promoting 20MB oldgen
Heap: Now running GC after promotion
Heap: Now done

❯ jfr print dump.jfr|head
jdk.PromoteObjectInNewPLAB {
  startTime = 12:57:54.086
  gcId = 0
  objectClass = java.lang.Object[] (classLoader = <bootloader>)
  objectSize = 3 bytes
  tenuringAge = 0
  tenured = false
  plabSize = 4.0 kB
  eventThread = "Gang worker#0 (Parallel GC Threads)" (osThreadId = 9475)
}
```

So we see an array being allocated, and _not_ being promoted, note `tenured=false`.

Where is the first time an object is promoted?

```bash
❯ jfr print dump.jfr|rg -C6 tenured.=.true|head
jdk.PromoteObjectInNewPLAB {
  startTime = 12:57:54.093
  gcId = 0
  objectClass = byte[] (classLoader = <bootloader>)
  objectSize = 66 bytes
  tenuringAge = 0
  tenured = true
  plabSize = 1.0 kB
  eventThread = "Gang worker#0 (Parallel GC Threads)" (osThreadId = 9475)
}
```

Wait, what? How come this object is tenured, however unlike what we said, the
`tenuringAge`

The test did _not_ work, object were promoted, but not because enought generation passed!

## What is PLAB?

To make a long story short, each thread in JVM has Promotion Local Allocation Buffer, or PLAB.
It is a piece of memory allocated from a G1 Region, which it uses to allocate new objects.

When we try to GC young region, we do that with multiple thread, and [each threads copy
the object it collects](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-jdk8u/blob/master/hotspot/src/share/vm/gc_implementation/g1/g1ParScanThreadState.cpp#L216-L236)
from the young region to its local PLAB buffer.

An `oop` is an _ordinary object pointer_ which we copy to survivor space:

```c++
oop G1ParScanThreadState::copy_to_survivor_space(InCSetState const state,
                                                 oop const old,
                                                 markOop const old_mark)
...
// we try to allocate space for the oop in our PLAB
HeapWord* obj_ptr = _g1_par_allocator->plab_allocate(dest_state, word_sz, context);
if (obj_ptr == NULL) {
  // if space in PLAB is gone, try to allocate in region a new region
  obj_ptr = _g1_par_allocator->allocate_direct_or_new_plab(dest_state, word_sz, context);
  if (obj_ptr == NULL) {
    // if no young regions could be found - just allocate an old one
    obj_ptr = allocate_in_next_plab(state, &dest_state, word_sz, context);
```

So, what we said is inexact, when one thread exausts its young generation space,
it would allocate from old generation instead, and would not promote the objects as
intended.

We need to find a way to make sure objects are indeed promoted due to tenureship,
and then see their `tenureAge` is indeed 15.

But how? See in [tenureme page](/simple/tenureme)
