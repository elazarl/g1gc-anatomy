# G1 Young Collection

## G1 101

### Basic Inexact GC Model

Reading about the G1 GC, in [various](https://youtu.be/9FiNsALl64k) [places](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/collecting-and-reading-g1-garbage-collector-logs-part-1)
Gives the following hight level, inaccurate, picture:

- Memory is divided to _regions_
- Regions are divided to Eden and Eldery space
- Mutator, the program at hand that _produces_ the garbage runs, and allocates
- At each allocation point, we fill the Eden space, if that is done _Evacuation Stop_ happens.

The _evacuation_ can be:

- Young collection, which can be supplemented by concurrent-mark
- Mixed, young and oldgen collection, if heap is full enough
- Full GC, which is done if memory pressure is high and we might be unable to allocate.

While these gloss over many things, such as humongous execution, it seems accurate enough.

Let's take a bite and try to see that in action.

## Provoking Young Collection

### G1 Visibility

The simplest metric we want to see from within a Java program, is how full the heap is.

We need no flags for that:

```java
public class AssertAllocVisible {
  public static void main() {
    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
    long before = rt.freeMemory();
    byte[] b = new byte[100 * 1024];
    assert before < rt.freeMemory();
  }
}
```

### Young GC Provoker

From that, we can build a primitive that would force an _evacation casue_.
We'll simply allocate and throw away until memory is reduced.

This technique might cause more than one GC cycle, but would stop after the first successful one:

```java
public class ProvokeYoungGC {
  public static void provoke() {
    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
    long freeBytes = rt.freeMemory();
    while (true) {
      byte[] bytes = new byte[512];
      long curFree = rt.freeMemory();
      // if this NOP made less memory we've had GC
      if (freeBytes < curFree)
        break;
      freeBytes = curFree;
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int n = 0;
    if (args.length > 0)
      n = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    for (int i=0;i<n;i++)
      provoke();
  }
}
```

#### Testing it

How can we see that it worked? The easiest way to install
JDK this days is [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/), we'll use both ends of the
JDK spectrum, JDK-8, which is stil used, and JDK-22, latest release.

##### JDK 8

```bash
sdk install java 8.0.402-amzn
sdk i java 22-tem

❯ sdk u java 8.0.402-amzn

Using java version 8.0.402-amzn in this shell.
❯ javac ProvokeYoungGC.java

❯ java -Xmx10M -verbose:gc -cp . ProvokeYoungGC
[GC (Allocation Failure)  4096K->496K(15872K), 0.0004601 secs]
````

Magnificent. We did provoke one GC. But which is it?

##### JDK 22

Let's try latest java for a change

```bash
❯ sdk u java 22-tem

Using java version 22-tem in this shell.

❯ javac ProvokeYoungGC.java

❯ java -Xmx10M -verbose:gc -cp . ProvokeYoungGC
[0.005s][info][gc] Using G1
[0.040s][info][gc] GC(0) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 8M->0M(16M) 0.468ms
```

Indeed, a young collection, using the G1 GC.

##### JDK 22 multiple rounds

Let's go crazy now, and try running 100 young gc

```bash
❯ javac ProvokeYoungGC.java

❯ java -verbose:gc -cp . ProvokeYoungGC 10
[0.003s][info][gc] Using G1
^C
```

Hey! It's stuck. How can it possibly be?

We allocate some bytes every loop iteration, and yet no GC occur.

#### Avoid JIT optimizations

The reason is newer `JVM`s offer
[escape analysis](https://blogs.oracle.com/javamagazine/post/escape-analysis-in-the-hotspot-jit-compiler)
that would allocate those bytes on the stack. To prevent that, we can use
`-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,Promoting.provoke`.

How can we see that indeed this is the case? First we can see this method is indeed JIT'd

```bash
❯ java -XX:+PrintCompilation -verbose:gc -cp . ProvokeYoungGC
[0.003s][info][gc] Using G1
20    1       3       java.lang.Object::<init> (1 bytes)
...
43   66 %     3       ProvokeYoungGC::provoke @ 9 (38 bytes)
43   67       3       ProvokeYoungGC::provoke (38 bytes)
49   68 %     4       ProvokeYoungGC::provoke @ 9 (38 bytes)
50   66 %     3       ProvokeYoungGC::provoke @ 9 (38 bytes)   made not entrant
```

The `%` means an [OSR](https://thangavel-blog.medium.com/java-on-stack-replacement-osr-b527ab3fff8c)
occured, and the rightmost `3` and `4` are the
[compilation level](https://javarush.com/en/groups/posts/en.2256.compiling-and-running-java-applications-under-the-hood#Just-in-time-(JIT)-%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8F%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F).
See [the implementation](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/jdk-23%2B25/src/hotspot/share/compiler/compileTask.cpp#L249)
for more details.


What can we do about it?

```bash
❯ java -XX:CompileCommand=exclude,ProvokeYoungGC.provoke -verbose:gc -cp . ProvokeYoungGC 10
[0.002s][info][gc] Using G1
CompileCommand: exclude ProvokeYoungGC.provoke bool exclude = true
[0.051s][info][gc] GC(0) Pause Young (Normal) (G1 Evacuation Pause) 64M->0M(1536M) 0.963ms
```

## Summary

Allocating enough objects would provoke a GC, and first GCs would be _young_ collections.

An easy way to detect GCs is adding `-verbose:gc` which is pretty portable across JDK versions.

[Next article](/simple/jfr) would show other ways to gain visibility about GCs.
