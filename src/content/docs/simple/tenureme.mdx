# Reliable Tenuring of Objects
## Premature Tenuring by PLAB

We've seen that many objects were tenured without surviving
`MaxTenuringThreshold` rounds of GC. We need to prevent that
to have a way of creating known amount of oldgen.

The gist of the problem was, we exhausted the PLAB, the thread
local buffer that is used to copy survivors of young generation 
to the next region.

If we run out of milk, we pick some more milk from the grocery stores.
But what do we do if we run out of PLABs?

Every thread has its own PLAB, so with more threads, we'll get more
PLABs:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ProvokeGC {
  public static void alloc() { byte[] _unused = new byte[512]; }
  public static void provoke() {
    int nplabs = 10;
    ArrayList<ExecutorService> svcs = new ArrayList<>(nplabs);
    for (int i = 0; i < nplabs; i++) {
      svcs.add(Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor());
    }
    Runtime rt = Runtime.getRuntime();
    long freeBytes = rt.freeMemory();
    int svc_ix = 0;
    while (true) {
      svcs.get(svc_ix).execute(() -> {
        alloc();
      });
      svc_ix = (svc_ix+1) % nplabs;

      long curFree = rt.freeMemory();
      // if this NOP made less memory we've had GC
      if (freeBytes < curFree)
        break;
      freeBytes = curFree;
    }
    for (ExecutorService svc : svcs) {
      svc.shutdown();
    }
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int times = 1;
    if (args.length == 1)
      times = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
    for (int i=0;i<times;i++)
      provoke();
  }
}

```
