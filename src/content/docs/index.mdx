**Garbage First**

This small website would describe the inner working of the
[G1 Garbage Collector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage-first_collector)
by building small examples that excersize its various mechanism.

We start by [forcing a young collection](/simple/young).

We detour to a short intro to [Java Flight Recorder](/simple/jfr) to gain visibility to the GC.

We'll show a naive failed approach to [promote objects into the old generation](/simple/oldgen-failed).

Then improve to PLAB-abundant version of the [oldgen-generator](/simple/tenureme).
